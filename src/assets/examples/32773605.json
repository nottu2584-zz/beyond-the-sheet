Nunca ha destacado por algo en especial, pero mostró interés por todas las enseñanzas que sus padres trataron de transmitirle a él y sus hermanos. Fue así como aprendió a servirse de las habilidades de su gente, a controlar sus instintos y convivir con la naturaleza, manteniendo un fino equilibrio entre la bestia interior y la razón.\n\nA pesar de que siempre estuvo arropado por todos, era algo distante, en ocasiones el joven salía al bosque a merodear, descansando contemplativo sobre la rama de algún árbol durante largas horas. En uno de esos pasatiempos, conoció a Hiedra, una joven de una aldea vecina del mismo bosque. Desde entonces han sido inseparables.\n\nHace poco más de siete años, los dos decidieron abandonar el bosque como muchos otros antes que ellos, para formar una familia en algún lugar donde pudieran asentarse. Durante el tiempo que estuvieron buscando ese sitio, tanto él como ella se unieron a La Estrella Plateada (una compañía mercantil de Nyanzaru) como protección. Este periodo duró algo más de cinco años, durante el cual sirvieron en diferentes naves, siempre en algún mar y en ocasiones separados durante meses.\n\nAmbos libres de su contrato cinco años más tarde y con un hogar al fin en su nombre, casi podían disfrutar de su tiempo juntos. No obstante las cosas no siempre son tan fáciles, y pronto la pareja descubrió que los continuos impuestos y problemas burocráticos de los cuales eran ignorantes les supondría un quebradero de cabeza.\n\nPor si fuera poco, Hiedra estaba embarazada, ese fue el único motivo para que Ceniza saliera a buscar un trabajo mejor pagado, algo que pueda permitirles vivir cómodamente mucho tiempo, a salvo.

Dos cinturones sujetan ambas prendas, uno de ellos sirve a la vaina de una espada. \nSu pantalón es holgado por encima de sus rodillas pero se encuentra completamente atado por debajo de ellas, mediante unas cintas en otro momento blancas, raídas. Por encima de ellas lleva unas grebas gemelas, de algún tipo de acero arañado y con numerosos golpes. Sus pies terminan en garras también, son visibles pues va prácticamente descalzo, viste algún tipo de calzado exótico que curiosamente solo cubre su planta y empeine.\n\nSobre los hombros, una capa azul marino, prácticamente rozando el negro, castigada, que se sujeta con un broche plateado y la cual no llega al suelo. A pesar de su aspecto, su confección parece fina y de calidad.\n\nEn su espalda un redondo y azulado escudo repleto de golpes y muescas, tiene una estrella de 16 puntas pintada sobre él.
